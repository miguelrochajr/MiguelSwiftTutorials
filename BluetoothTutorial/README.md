# BLE Tutorial using CoreBletooth

This project was done by following the tutorial [Zero to BLE os iOS](https://www.cloudcity.io/blog/2015/06/11/zero-to-ble-on-ios-part-one/)

It is important to mention that the [original project](https://github.com/cloudcity/ZeroToBLE-Part2-Swift) was written in Swift 2 while this was written in Swift 3. Another thing to be aware is that here I am not using the SensorTag from Texas Instruments. I am using a smart padlock that I had laying around.
