## Core Bluetooth 

[BluetoothTutorial](https://github.com/miguelrochajr/SwiftTutorials/tree/master/BluetoothTutorial)

This tutorial is an introduction to how the Core Bluetooth works. I used a particular bluetooth device in order to experiment with the peripheral, manager, connection, characteristics, feedback and services to interact with the gadget.

## Building UI interface without Storyboard

[CloneProjects->youtube_2](https://github.com/miguelrochajr/SwiftTutorials/tree/master/CloneProjects/LetsBuildThatApp-YouTubeClone)

  As the name implies, the code in the project shows how an User Interface could be built using only Swift 3, with no XML from the storyboard. The video reference used here was by Brian Voong and (THIS)[Swift: Lets Build YouTube - Home Feed: UICollectionView, AutoLayout ...] as the YouTube playlist followed.
  Keep in mind that the videos are written in Swift 2 and some commands had to be updated.
